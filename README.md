# Quacker

*Quacker* is an example of best practices in Java, using the functionality of Twitter as a benchmark. The goal is to implement a (silly, non-scaling, barely-functional) Twitter clone in order to explore the following concepts:

  * [Behaviour-Driven Development][]
  * [object calisthenics][]
  * [mocking][Growing Object-Oriented Software] with [JMock][]
  * functional programming using [Java 8][Java 8: Project Lambda]
  * [dependency injection][] using [Guice][]
  * and more.
